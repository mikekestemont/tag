# A Convolutional Lemmatizer for Variation-Rich languages

The code in this repository was used to produce the results in the following paper:

    Mike Kestemont, Guy de Pauw, Renske van Nie, and Walter Daelemans, 'Lemmatization for Variation-Rich Languages Using Deep Learning'. *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities* [2016], doi:10.1093/llc/fqw034.

The code uses the API in [Keras](https://keras.io/) version < 1.0 and will not run with the current keras API; therefore this repository is merely kept for reference purposes. If you are interested in using our lemmatization approach with your own data please refer to the [Pandora repository](https://github.com/mikekestemont/pandora). Although this tagger-lemmatizer is still work in progress, this architecture has options that allow you to apply the convolutional approach to your data. Documentation is on the way. Queries etc. can be filed as issues on the Pandora repository.
